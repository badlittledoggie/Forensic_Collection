# Forensic_Collection
One way to collect digital forensic data for an investigation using your favorite tools. 
I have used these tools when working for a Fortune 500 company to collect forensic data. We took the .e0x files and loaded them into the forensic software we were using.
You can upload the .e0x files into your favorite forensic software: Encase, FTK, BlackLight, Autopsy etc...
